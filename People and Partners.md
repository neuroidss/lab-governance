# People and Partners
Purpose, Domains, Accountabilities defined by parent circle.

## Strategy
- Improve the quality of how we work together until we are ready to grow again // only get new partners if there is a major and persistent pain that a new partner would solve
- Building a sufficient freelancer pool even over having new partners
- If we hire - Recruit experienced people we can learn from to have sufficient mentoring capacity before we hire more novice people with high potential
- Have impact in one area quickly even over having small improvements across the board.

##### Policy: Async governance process
See [Async governance process as TLC](README.md#policy-async-governance-process-tlc)

##### Policy: Mentors
Any Partner can assign themself to the Mentor role (with the focus of the mentee) if another partner asked you to be their mentor

##### Policy: Firing Process
- Anybody can be fired with one month notice period, who (1) has been without a role for at least 1 months, or (2) Partner's roles all together do not require at least 50% of the agreed work time in the last 1 month. Firing decision needs to be approved by all of these roles: HR LL, Resource Clarity and Biz. If the Partner gets a role within the notice period, than the firing process stops.

*Secretary interpretation*
- Granting access to legal notice and firing to Roles outside the P&P circle (for roles in the P&P circle this part of the policy means no restrictions):
  - Any role outside the P&P circle may give legal notice to a Partner when
    - the Partner has been without a role for at least 1 month,
    - or the Role senses that Partner's roles all together do not require at least 50% of the agreed work time in the last 1 month.
  - Any role outside the P&P circle may fire a Partner who was given legal notice one month prior.
- Limiting acccess to legal notice and firing of any Role who has access to it (including the roles who got permission above):
  - A Role may only fire a Partner after having approval from all partners filling the folling roles: PP LL, TLC Resource Clarity and TLC Biz.
  - A Role may only fire a Partner who got a legal notice and has been without a role for at least 1 month before the legal notice if the Partner hasn't energized a Role after recieving the legal notice.
- (These role-based permissions may be further limited by corporate law, outside Governance. For example which Partner may legally represent the company.)



## Domain: Partner relations (except text of contracts)

##### Policy: Human resource dedication
- Partners can be dedicated to work on a Client projects
  - Each week (in average) works on the Client Project for the time agreed with the Client
- For changing dedication, permission is necessary from the following roles:
  - Biz
  - Sales
  - Recruiter
  - Legal representative
  - HR Circle LL
  - Resource Clarity

- Permission is necessary (with the above roles) in case of changes of:
  - FTE
  - Roles in direct contact with the client
  - Contract
  - Price, pricing
  - Project timeframe
- The above listed roles can block the above listed changes up to 2 weeks before the legal minimum stated (usually 4 weeks), if the roles decide within their domains that the upcoming change is not safe to fail. Moreover, it is highly preferred not to change within 6 months, and to change at the time of contract change.
- Minimum 6 months on a client project, except agreed otherwise with the client.
- No more than 1 person should be replaced within one month, except agreed otherwise with the client.

##### Policy: Vacation and Learning Time Limit
If you are sold to a client, you can schedule additional vacation / learning time if the 3 month moving average of holidays that only exist in Hungary, vacation time, learning time, and sick leave, is within the bounds of the [FTE definition](#policy-fte-definitions).

##### Policy: Holidays / Learning Time / Home office / Sick leave notification and approval
Clearly distinguish (in writing, talking, calendar, timesheet etc.) between Holidays / Learning Time / Home office / Sick leave

Mark everything in your calendar as soon as you're aware of it.

**Holidays / Learning Time** self-approval check-list to make your absence safe:
- I've notified all my circle-mates on Slack of my holiday plans
    - I also wrote in the same Slack message that I've put the holiday in my work calendar. (eg. "I plan to be on holiday from X to Y. It's also in my calendar.")
    - I did this no later then 2x workdays of its length, but minimum 5 workdays
    - There was no objection
- There is no big/key release, milestone, contract, meeting, which require me
- There is no project start / end, which involves me
- I have notified the resource clarity role.
- If the leave is longer than 5 work days, Resource Clarity has acknowledged my leave.
- If needed, there is someone to take my Role or Task over, who I have exactly told what to do and what did I agree with the involved Roles or Client etc. with. If there is a substitute it's added to Github to the header of the given role.
- The fellow partners' holidays and planned sick leaves are not in conflict with mine
- In teams over 3 FTE, more than 50% FTE of the team can only go on holidays / training / sick leave, if it is pre-approved by the client. Of course, sick leave can not be pre-planned, but if due pre-planned holidays and unexpected sick leaves the team shrinks below 50%, then the team needs to get a client approval. In case of rejection from the client with a strong reasoning (for example a top prio bug), the holiday needs to be suspended. In case this causes personal costs, it needs to be compensated by the company.

**Sick leave**: notify ASAP and keep others up-to-date about your how being and expected first day of work.

**Home office**: Let your circles on Slack know on the previous day if you would like to work from home all day long.

In case of **Holidays and Home office**, letting them know within this period doesn't mean that it's not allowed, but can be declined, if your plan is not safe to fail.

##### Policy: Work hours
We do not have fixed office hours, like 9to5. It is flexible and partners schedule their own time. However, Partners need to attend to the agreed meetings and be available for our clients. It is the Partners' responsibility to use their time in the best interest of the company and the clients. The company does not pay for overtime.

##### Policy: Company financed learning (for everyone and all circles in the Lab)
- Up to 170 EUR + VAT / Full time Partner / month (incl. travel costs), 2040 EUR + VAT / Full Time Partner / year
- Part time Partners can spend in proportion to their % of full time employment
- A Partner's budget can be cummulated, so if a Partner does not use his/her budget in the given month or year, it can be used later on
- If monthly learning spending is ≥ Number of Partners * 170 EUR + VAT, than it requires approval from the Finance role in order to secure cash flow
- You can only spend company money on learning if you get an invoice for the company.
- Learning budget includes travel and related costs as defined in [Policy: Business cost reimbursement](#policy-business-cost-reimbursement) so that all these costs count against your learning budget.
- Make it transparent at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n1xfIGBuBe1IAIjhP-SUL0LrzrLgYIjZm2XaaFaV-rY/edit#gid=0
- If a Partner spends on learning during his/her probation time and decides to leave before the probation ends s/he has to pay back the amount s/he spent on learning.
- Learning budget over 2040 EUR / year is the domain of the Biz role as it becomes an investment for the company.
- If a Partner leaves the company and his/her cummulative learning budget balance is over the 170 EUR / month average, the Partner need to pay back the budget overuse proportionally to the company. For example the Partner has worked 20 months for the company and has spent 4400 EUR on learning, then the Partner owes 1000 EUR to the company. (20*170=3400 vs. 4400)
- In case a Partner does not want to use a larger learning budget, as the agreed one (just as described above), s/he has the option to access the budget against his or her preferred dividend stocks. (For example 10k HUF budget overuse would mean getting 10k less preferred dividend stocks in that given quarter or year.) In this case there is no employment commitment or repayment obligation.
- A team training, workshop, course etc.'s cost needs to be administrated in splits between the participants. For example: English lesson.
- Pay by company card/transfer if possible.
- Make a brownbag talk about your learning if applicable
- Secretary Interpretation: Exam/certification fees can also be financed from the learning budget.

##### Policy: Employee Benefits (for everyone and all circles in the Lab)

In case a Partner needs to purchase for example a software or content, s/he needs to follow the relevant Company Purchases policy and consult with the Tech Support Role, if needed. https://github.com/lab-coop/lab-governance#policy-company-purchases

##### Policy: Conflict resolution process
Applies to any type of disagreement. This could be a difference of opinion about a technical decision, an interpersonal conflict or a breach of values. Specifically, it can be used in performance issues when one colleague believes that another is not pulling his weight.

Since the disagreement is private, all parties are expected to respect confidentiality during and after the processes. Of course, this confidentiality also applies to the two persons at the heart of the conflict. They must resolve their disagreement between themselves and are discouraged from spreading the conflict by enlisting support and building rival factions.

 1. Whatever the topic, the process starts with one person asking another to gain agreement: In a first phase, they sit together and try to sort it out privately. Both parties should use NonViolent Communication practices to communicate clear Observation, Feelings, Needs, Requests and Responses

   - Observation: the facts (what we are seeing, hearing, or touching) as distinct from our evaluation of meaning and significance. NVC discourages static generalizations. It is said that "When we combine observation with evaluation others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying." Instead, a focus on observations specific to time and context is recommended.
   - Feelings: emotions or sensations, free of thought and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what we think we are (e.g., "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., "unimportant"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., "misunderstood", "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts.
   - Needs: universal human needs, as distinct from particular strategies for meeting needs.
   - Request: request for a specific action, free of demand. Requests are distinguished from demands in that one is open to hearing a response of "no" without this triggering an attempt to force the matter. If one makes a request and receives a "no" it is recommended not that one give up, but that one empathize with what is preventing the other person from saying "yes," before deciding how to continue the conversation. It is recommended that requests use clear, positive, concrete action language.
   - Response: The receiving person has to respond clearly to the request:
     - with a "yes"
     - needs that prevent you from saying yes,
     - and/or a counterproposal.


 1. If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both of them, they nominate a colleague they both trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather he or she supports the participants in coming to their own solution.

 1. If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant colleagues is convened. The panel’s role, again, is to listen and help shape agreement. It cannot force a decision, but usually carries enough moral weight for matters to come to a conclusion.

 1. In an ultimate step, the Top Level Circle Lead Link, can be called into the panel, to further reinforce the panel’s moral weight (but not to impose a solution).

## Domain: Compensation

##### Policy: Defining Badges
The Organization's official “Badge Library” lists “Badges” that are available for Partners to earn in recognition of their skills, talents, capacities, and achievements. Each Badge definition must include a description of the skill, talent, capacity, or achievement that the Badge represents, and may optionally include a process or another mechanism for Partners to gain the Badge and/or lose the Badge.

No one may add, modify, or remove Badges from the Badge Library unless each @Badge_Librarian first confirms he/she sees no Objections to the change, or fails to respond with an Objection within a week of a proposed change. In any case however, no Badge in the Badge Library may be modified or removed while another process or active decision relies on the Badge (although it may be marked as "inactive" and made unavailable for new use, and an updated version may be added for new use instead).

##### Policy: Earning & Losing Badges
If no mechanism is specified along with a Badge definition for how a Partner gains that Badge, then, as a default mechanism, the following will apply:
A Partner will be granted the Badge when at least two people who already hold the Badge assert that they have clearly and repeatedly seen the candidate demonstrate the skill or capacity described by the Badge. However, if there aren't enough people who actually hold the Badge and have worked with the candidate to assess that, then the @Badge_Bootstrapper's may instead grant the badge using any evidence they see fit, as long as a majority of the @Badge_Bootstrapper's advocate for the grant and none actively advocate against it. If the candidate for this grant is also a @Badge_Bootstrapper, he/she shall not count for the purpose of assessing his/heir own Badge nomination.

If no mechanism is specified along with a Badge definition for how a Partner loses that Badge, then, as a default mechanism, the following will apply:
The Badge grant will automatically expire 6 months after grant, unless renewed via the same mechanism required for the initial grant. Further, the Badge grant may be revoked sooner by any two people who already hold the Badge asking for a re-qualification, and the Partner failing to promptly re-qualify for the Badge using whatever mechanism is required for the initial grant of the Badge.

If a Partner from their own personal preference chooses not to spend significant time in some area of work then that Partner looses the badges relating to that area of work. If a Partner does not spend significant time in a Role to align with Organizational priorities and not by personal preference, the partner does not loose badges.

##### Policy: Badge Valuation
The "Badge Valuation Database" is a listing of specific sets of Badges, with each set mapped to a specific compensation level using the levels defined by Compensation Architect.

The full-time compensation level for a Partner may only be set at `100% - (investment %)` of the `personal market compensation benchmark` or the prorated equivalent for a part-time commitment. The `personal market compensation benchmark` is the highest pay level that matches a set of Badges the Partner holds. In the normal case the `investment` is 20%.

Any Partner who is financially responsible for another person may choose to reduce their `investment` in the company from 20% to 10%. In this case their `investment` for the liquid ownership calculation may only be treated as the 10% they invest in the company, without any adjustments.

If a partner's compensation level would decrease, the compensation level can only be calculated with no more than 10% monthly decrease except if the Partner agrees to a faster or immediate decrease.
_(Intent is to avoid sudden 0 pay penalty for a partner's negligance)_

Compensation changes for Partners may only take effect in quarterly batches, after dividend pay.

The Badge Valuation Database may only be modified via a Proposal that results in no Objections from all @Compensation_Guardian's, using the Integrative Decision-Making Process. This Proposal may be made asynchronously to just the @Compensation_Guardian's, using the Constitution's rules for asynchronous processing, or via a special "Badge Valuation Meeting" scheduled by any Partner. All @Compensation_Guardian's must be invited to this meeting, as well as this Circle's elected Facilitator, and it may only be scheduled for 30 minutes. A majority of the @Compensation_Guardian's must attend for the meeting to proceed, and even with a majority it may not proceed if any @Compensation_Guardian requests a reschedule.

At a Badge Valuation Meeting, the Partner who scheduled the meeting may propose one or more new or modified badge set valuations for the Badge Valuation Database, and the facilitator of the meeting will process the Proposal via the Integrative Decision-Making Process, but with only the @Compensation_Guardian's participating in the Objection Round (if the elected Facilitator chooses not to attend, the Constitution's rules for selecting a surrogate apply). Any Proposal that fails to pass within the time allotted for the meeting is automatically dropped. No Partner may schedule a Badge Valuation Meeting within one month of the last such meeting that Partner scheduled.

Through the process defined above, the valuation tied to any Badge set may be lowered, or more Badges may be added to an existing set. In these cases, any Partner whose compensation level was tied to that Badge set may keep their compensation level calculated using the old Badge set and associated valuation for a period of 3 months following the change; at that point, compensation levels due to legacy Badge sets or valuations will automatically expire.

##### Policy: Transitioning to Badge-Based Compensation
Any role extending offers for new Partners to join the Organization may give those new Partners an initial compensation level based on a set of Badges the role-filler assumes the new Partner is likely to earn (additional governance may define or limit this authority further). Partner's compensation may not drop below this initial tier placement for a period of 3 months after joining the Organization (except due to a shift to a part-time relationship or removal from the Organization).

Partners who joined the company before the roll-out of the Badge-based Compensation System may opt to keep their compensation level calculated under the old system until they have enough Badges to provide a comparable or greater compensation level under the new system.

##### Policy: Part-time ratio retroactive adjustments

##### Note of Recruiter: Part-time criteria
(My best guesses so far, open for input and change)

Part-time is okay if the person gives gives the company at least 60% focus time. Less focus time carries a high risk of painfully slow integration (if ever happens). Coordination overhead also grows with less focus time.

> "if they leave unfinished work in a way that its expensive for others continue it, then its not really useful to have a 50% dev because you can't give them time-critical tasks because of the risk that they start a 4.5 day weekend without finishing. If their unfinished work is continuable by others, then I would definitely hire them."

University is okay if it ends soon.

Non-profit / hobbi / volunteer side projects are fine.

For-profit, For-equity side projects are not okay due to the cost of boundary managment, they indicate low commitment. They are okay temporarly as they are phased out.
