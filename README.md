##### Policy: Free floating developers
Any Partner can add or remove a Free Floating Developer role assignment to themselves.

##### Policy: Async governance process (TLC)
1. Create a pull request from your proposal. Put your tension in the description of the pull request.
2. Members of the circle have 3 workdays to ask Clarifying Questions, give Reactions, voice Objections. Every pull request is automatically posted to Slack's #governance. You can mark the requests on the GitHub by comments.
   - You can show your support with :+1: ( that is _colon_ + "+1" + _colon_ )
   - If you have a Clarifying Question and it block you from deciding if you have an Objection mark your question with :question: ( that is _colon_ + "question" + _colon_ ). This blocks the proposal until the proposer clarifies.
   - Mark your Objections with :exclamation: ( that is _colon_ + "exclamation" + _colon_ ). This signs to the proposer that you see a reason why adopting the current form of the proposal would degrade the capacity of the Circle to express its Purpose or enact its Accountabilities. (See the [Constitution for the criteria for valid objections](https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/master/Holacracy-Constitution.md#324-criteria-for-valid-objections))
   - At any point before an asynchronous Proposal is adopted, any Core Circle Member may stop the asynchronous processing by adding a with :boom: ( that is _colon_ + "boom" + _colon_ ) mark requesting the Proposer escalate the Proposal to a Governance Meeting.
   - If you had have questions and/or objections, and those got resolved, you need to mark the proposal good-to-go by :white_check_mark: (that is  _colon_ + "white_check_mark" + _colon_ ).
   - If you don't read the proposal in this time it's like when you don't attend the governance meeting. If the accepted proposal created tensions in your roles, please bring the tension and your proposal for the next governance meeting or create a new pull request.
3. You can amend and clarify your proposal, integrate objections by adding changes to the pull request. The time window for Clarifying Questions, Reactions and Objections restart with each amendment or clarification.
4. Any core circle member can merge the pull request if there are no objections in the given period.
