## Domain: All functions & activities within the Circle

##### Policy: Agenda building and administration
 - Proposals are announced and written down in English.
 - Put your proposal in words before the governance meeting in a Pull Request.

##### Policy: Async governance process (TLC)
1. Create a pull request from your proposal. Put your tension in the description of the pull request.
2. Members of the circle have 3 workdays to ask Clarifying Questions, give Reactions, voice Objections. Every pull request is automatically posted to Slack's #governance. You can mark the requests on the GitHub by comments.
   - You can show your support with :+1: ( that is _colon_ + "+1" + _colon_ )
   - If you have a Clarifying Question and it block you from deciding if you have an Objection mark your question with :question: ( that is _colon_ + "question" + _colon_ ). This blocks the proposal until the proposer clarifies.
   - Mark your Objections with :exclamation: ( that is _colon_ + "exclamation" + _colon_ ). This signs to the proposer that the current form of the proposal would degrade the capacity of the Circle to express its Purpose or enact its Accountabilities. (See the [Constitution for the criteria for valid objections](https://github.com/holacracyone/Holacracy-Constitution/blob/master/Holacracy-Constitution.md#324-criteria-for-valid-objections))
   - If you had have questions and/or objections, and those got resolved, you need to mark the proposal good-to-go by :white_check_mark: (that is  _colon_ + "white_check_mark" + _colon_ ).
   - If you don't read the proposal in this time it's like when you don't attend the governance meeting. If the accepted proposal created tensions in your roles, please bring the tension and your proposal for the next governance meeting or create a new pull request.
3. You can amend and clarify your proposal, integrate objections by adding changes to the pull request. The time window for Clarifying Questions, Reactions and Objections restart with each amendment or clarification.
4. Any core circle member can merge the pull request if there are no objections in the given period.

##### Policy: Long policies
Policy proposals longer than 10 sentences must be shared at least 48h before the governance meeting to enable the circle to prepare properly for the governance meeting. If the policy is complex than pre-governance discussions are preferable.

##### Policy: Asana for top level boards
Use [Asana](https://app.asana.com/0/33571529181923/list) for top level circle boards

##### Policy: Vacation and Learning Time Limit
If you are sold to a client, you can schedule additional vacation / learning time if the 3 month moving average of holidays that only exist in Hungary, vacation time, learning time, and sick leave, is within the bounds of the [FTE definition](#policy-fte-definitions).

##### Policy: Holidays / Learning Time / Home office / Sick leave notification and approval
- Clearly distinguish (in writing, talking, calendar, timesheet etc.) between Holidays / Learning Time / Home office / Sick leave
- Mark everything in your calendar as soon as you're aware of it.
- Holidays / Learning Time self-approval check-list to make your absence safe
 - I've notified all my circle-mates over Slack not later then 2x workdsays of its length, but minimum 5 workdays and there was no objection
 - There is no big/key release, milestone, contract, meeting, which require me
 - There is no project start / end, which involves me
 - I have notified the resource clarity role.
 - If the leave is longer than 5 work days, Resource Clarity has acknowledged my leave.
 - If needed, there is someone to take my Role or Task over, who I have exactly told what to do and what did I agree with the involved Roles or Client etc. with. If there is a substitute it's added to Github to the header of the given role.
 - The fellow partners' holidays and planned sick leaves are not in conflict with mine
 - In teams over 3 FTE, more than 50% FTE of the team can only go on holidays / training / sick leave, if it is pre-approved by the client. Of course, sick leave can not be pre-planned, but if due pre-planned holidays and unexpected sick leaves the team shrinks below 50%, then the team needs to get a client approval. In case of rejection from the client with a strong reasoning (for example a top prio bug), the holiday needs to be suspended. In case this causes personal costs, it needs to be compensated by the company.
- Sick leave: notify ASAP and keep others uptodate about your how being and expected first day of work.
- Home office: Let your circles on Slack know on the previous day if you would like to work from home all day long.
- In case of Holidays and Home office, letting them know within this period doesn't mean that it's not allowed, but can be declined, if your plan is not safe to fail.

##### Policy: Work hours
We do not have fixed office hours, like 9to5. It is flexible and partners schedule their own time. However, Partners need to attend to the agreed meetings and be available for our clients. It is the Partners' responibility to use their time in the best interest of the company and the clients. The company does not pay for overtime.




## Domain: Company resources (mandatory for all roles and circles)

##### Policy: Business cost reimbursement
- All costs during a business travel should be covered, including food, transportation, accommodation, representation costs.
- Preferably paid by a company bank card. Always provide invoices.
- Costs of business meeting (coffees / lunches / dinnerrs / beers etc.) and beer dates can be fully reimbursed.
- All costs must be within a common sense limit. No ***** hotel, no luxury.

##### Policy: Company financed learning (for everyone and all circles in the Lab)
- Up to 170 EUR + VAT / Full time Partner / month (incl. travel costs), 2040 EUR + VAT / Full Time Partner / year
- Part time Partners can spend in proportion to their % of full time employment
- A Partner's budget can be cummulated, so if a Partner does not use his/her budget in the given month or year, it can be used later on
- If monthly learning spending is ≥ Number of Partners * 170 EUR + VAT, than it requires approval from the Biz role in order to secure cash flow
- Get an invoice for the company. Pay by company card/transfer if possible.
- Learning budget includes travel and related costs as defined in [Policy: Business cost reimbursement](#policy-business-cost-reimbursement) so that all these costs count against your learning budget.
- Make it transparent at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1n1xfIGBuBe1IAIjhP-SUL0LrzrLgYIjZm2XaaFaV-rY/edit#gid=0
- Make a brownbag talk about your learning if applicable
- If a Partner spends on learning during his/her probation time and decides to leave before the probation ends s/he has to pay back the amount s/he spent on learning.
- Learning budget over 2040 EUR / year is the domain of the Biz role as it becomes an investment for the company.
- If a Partner leaves the company and his/her cummulative learning budget balance is over the 170 EUR / month average, the Partner need to pay back the budget overuse proportionally to the company. For example the Partner has worked 20 months for the company and has spent 4400 EUR on learning, then the Partner owes 1000 EUR to the company. (20*170=3400 vs. 4400)
- In case a Partner does not want to use a larger learning budget, as the agreed one (just as described above), s/he has the option to access the budget against his or her preferred dividend stocks. (For example 10k HUF budget overuse would mean getting 10k less preferred dividend stocks in that given quarter or year.) In this case there is no employment commitment or repayment obligation.
- A team training, workshop, course etc.'s cost needs to be administrated in splits between the participants. For example: English lesson.
- Secretary Interpretation: Exam/certification fees can also be financed from the learning budget.

##### Policy: Conflict resolution process
Applies to any type of disagreement. This could be a difference of opinion about a technical decision, an interpersonal conflict or a breach of values. Specifically, it can be used in performance issues when one colleague believes that another is not pulling his weight.

Since the disagreement is private, all parties are expected to respect confidentiality during and after the processes. Of course, this confidentiality also applies to the two persons at the heart of the conflict. They must resolve their disagreement between themselves and are discouraged from spreading the conflict by enlisting support and building rival factions.

 1. Whatever the topic, the process starts with one person asking another to gain agreement: In a first phase, they sit together and try to sort it out privately. Both parties should use NonViolent Communication practices to communicate clear Observation, Feelings, Needs, Requests and Responses

   - Observation: the facts (what we are seeing, hearing, or touching) as distinct from our evaluation of meaning and significance. NVC discourages static generalizations. It is said that "When we combine observation with evaluation others are apt to hear criticism and resist what we are saying." Instead, a focus on observations specific to time and context is recommended.
   - Feelings: emotions or sensations, free of thought and story. These are to be distinguished from thoughts (e.g., "I feel I didn't get a fair deal") and from words colloquially used as feelings but which convey what we think we are (e.g., "inadequate"), how we think others are evaluating us (e.g., "unimportant"), or what we think others are doing to us (e.g., "misunderstood", "ignored"). Feelings are said to reflect whether we are experiencing our needs as met or unmet. Identifying feelings is said to allow us to more easily connect with one another, and allowing ourselves to be vulnerable by expressing our feelings can help resolve conflicts.
   - Needs: universal human needs, as distinct from particular strategies for meeting needs.
   - Request: request for a specific action, free of demand. Requests are distinguished from demands in that one is open to hearing a response of "no" without this triggering an attempt to force the matter. If one makes a request and receives a "no" it is recommended not that one give up, but that one empathize with what is preventing the other person from saying "yes," before deciding how to continue the conversation. It is recommended that requests use clear, positive, concrete action language.
   - Response: The receiving person has to respond clearly to the request:
     - with a "yes"
     - needs that prevent you from saying yes,
     - and/or a counterproposal.


 1. If they can’t find a solution agreeable to both of them, they nominate a colleague they both trust to act as a mediator. The mediator doesn’t impose a decision. Rather he or she supports the participants in coming to their own solution.

 1. If mediation fails, a panel of topic-relevant colleagues is convened. The panel’s role, again, is to listen and help shape agreement. It cannot force a decision, but usually carries enough moral weight for matters to come to a conclusion.

 1. In an ultimate step, the Top Level Circle Lead Link, can be called into the panel, to further reinforce the panel’s moral weight (but not to impose a solution).
