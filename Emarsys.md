## All functions & activities within the Circle

##### Policy: Dependency resolution
The assignee should resolve any emerging dependency for the current week.

##### Policy: Holidays / Home office / Sick leave notification and approval
You have to clearly distinguish between holidays, home office and sick leave. Mark it in your calendar as soon as you're aware of it.
- Holidays: Let your circles on Slack and your clients know 3x the length of your planned holiday (in workdays) before the start of it, but minimum 5 workdays before in writing
In case of Holidays and Home office, letting them know within this period doesn't mean that it's not allowed, but can be declined, if your plan is not safe to fail.
- Sick leave: notify ASAP and keep others uptodate about your how being and expected first day of work.

##### Policy: Estimation
Next week's commitment is reestimated by the team before the demo, 
taking the roadmap into account.
UI tasks' estimation must be based on existing and approved mockups.
If a UI task has backend dependencies, then the backend and frontend tasks must be defined in
separate tasks in the same user story.
If there is lack of information to estimate a user story, then estimation is
forbidden and has to be marked.

##### Policy: JIRA usage
We set the assignee and the assigner, we discuss and clarify all the AC. 
We add external dependencies as tasks for the Emarsys staff. 
If you find a bug add it to JIRA backlog.

##### Policy: Definition of well-defined
A well defined task should:
- have acceptance criteria
- contain only one UI component
- have mockups

##### Policy: Definition of done
A card only can move to done if:
- there are integration tests about the acceptance criteria
- unit test coverage is almost 100%
- deployed to stage and production
- AC is manually tested on production
- reviewed by other
- works in local
- doesn't break the build
- you informed the others about the breaking changes

##### Policy: QA
Every task must have someone who will assure its quality. 
He/She has to check on the staging environment whether all AC are met. 
Every task have to be QA-d by its assigner in JIRA with special attention to edge cases.
